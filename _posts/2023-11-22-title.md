GitHub Pages is a feature of GitHub that allows you to create and host a website for your project, your portfolio, your blog, or anything else you want to share with the world. GitHub Pages is free, easy to use, and supports custom domains and themes. In this article, we will learn the basics of GitHub Pages and how it has changed over time.

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files from a repository on GitHub and publishes them as a website. You can use any static site generator, such as Jekyll, Hugo, or Eleventy, to create your site, or you can simply write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. GitHub Pages also supports Markdown, a lightweight markup language that lets you write formatted text using plain text syntax.

GitHub Pages offers two types of sites: user or organization sites and project sites. A user or organization site is a site that is associated with your GitHub username or organization name. It has a URL like username.github.io or organization.github.io, where username or organization is your GitHub username or organization name. A project site is a site that is associated with a specific repository on GitHub. It has a URL like username.github.io/repository or organization.github.io/repository, where username or organization is your GitHub username or organization name, and repository is the name of the repository.

You can have one user or organization site per GitHub account, and unlimited project sites per repository. You can also use a custom domain name for your GitHub Pages site, such as example.com or blog.example.com, by configuring a CNAME record with your DNS provider.

## How did GitHub Pages start?

GitHub Pages was launched in April 2008, along with the GitHub website. It was initially a simple service that allowed users to host static HTML files from their repositories. The first GitHub Pages site was the GitHub blog, which used the Jekyll static site generator. Jekyll was created by GitHub co-founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner in November 2007, and was inspired by the Textpattern and Movable Type blogging platforms. Jekyll takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with GitHub Pages or any web server.  

In July 2008, GitHub Pages added support for custom domains, allowing users to host their sites on their own domain names. Users could also use GitHub Pages to host their project documentation, by creating a gh-pages branch in their repository and pushing their site files to it.  

In October 2008, GitHub Pages introduced themes, which are pre-made designs and layouts that users can apply to their sites. GitHub Pages initially offered six themes, based on popular open source projects such as Rails, Blueprint, and MooTools. Users could also create their own themes using HTML, CSS, and Liquid, a templating language.  

## How did GitHub Pages grow?

GitHub Pages continued to grow and improve over the years, adding more features and options for users. Some of the notable milestones are:

- In November 2010, GitHub Pages added support for HTTPS, making the sites more secure and reliable. Users could also enforce HTTPS redirects for their custom domains, by adding a file named .nojekyll to the root of their site.  
- In May 2011, GitHub Pages added support for submodules, allowing users to include other repositories in their site. This was useful for adding external libraries, plugins, or themes to the site. Users could also use submodules to host multiple sites from a single repository, by creating subdirectories for each site and adding a .nojekyll file to each subdirectory.  
- In October 2012, GitHub Pages added support for GitHub Flavored Markdown, a variant of Markdown that adds some extra features, such as syntax highlighting, tables, and task lists. Users could also use HTML tags and attributes in their Markdown files, giving them more flexibility and control over their site.  
- In April 2013, GitHub Pages added support for GitHub Actions, a feature that allows users to create custom workflows for building and deploying their site. Users could use GitHub Actions to run any command or script on their site files, such as installing dependencies, running tests, or minifying assets. Users could also use GitHub Actions to deploy their site to other hosting services, such as Amazon S3, Firebase, or Netlify.  
- In May 2016, GitHub Pages changed its pricing model from a repository-based one to a user-based one. Previously, users had to pay for private repositories, which limited the number of private sites they could host. With the new pricing model, users could have unlimited private repositories, and therefore unlimited private sites, for a fixed monthly fee. This made GitHub Pages more affordable and accessible for users who wanted to host their personal or professional sites privately.  

## What is the future of GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is still one of the most popular and widely used features of GitHub, with millions of sites hosted on it. GitHub Pages is constantly evolving and improving, adding more features and options for users. Some of the recent and upcoming developments are:

- In June 2020, GitHub Pages added support for Eleventy, a newer and faster static site generator that supports multiple template languages and formats. Users could use Eleventy to create more dynamic and interactive sites, using data files, filters, shortcodes, and plugins.  
- In August 2020, GitHub Pages added support for YAML front matter, a way of adding metadata to Markdown files. Users could use YAML front matter to specify the title, date, layout, categories, tags, and other information for their site pages. YAML front matter also enabled users to use collections, a feature that allows users to group related pages together and access them as a list.  
- In October 2020, GitHub Pages added support for GitHub Codespaces, a feature that allows users to create and edit their site files in a cloud-based development environment. Users could use GitHub Codespaces to preview their site locally, without having to install any software or dependencies on their machine. Users could also use GitHub Codespaces to collaborate with other users on their site, by sharing and joining codespaces.  
- In December 2020, GitHub Pages added support for GitHub Discussions, a feature that allows users to create and join conversations about their site or project. Users could use GitHub Discussions to ask questions, share feedback, or provide updates on their site. GitHub Discussions also integrated with GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, making it easier for users to track and resolve issues or suggestions for their site.  

GitHub Pages is more than just a simple static site hosting service. It is a powerful platform for web development, that leverages the features and benefits of GitHub. GitHub Pages allows users to create and host beautiful, fast, and secure websites, using the tools and technologies they love. GitHub Pages also enables users to collaborate and communicate with other users, and to learn and grow as web developers. GitHub Pages is the ultimate way to showcase your work and share your ideas with the world.
